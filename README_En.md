- Open Source Commercial Use: No need to contact; you can use it directly. However, you need to add the URL of your open-source library to the bottom of your official website (according to the open-source license, you need to make your source code public). The GPL license allows you to modify the code and share your modifications, but it does not authorize you to modify copyright information, so copyright information cannot be modified.
- Closed Source Commercial Use: Contact is required to obtain commercial authorization. Depending on the terms of the commercial authorization agreement, you may be legally permitted to modify copyright information.
- Commercial Authorization Price: 3,000 USD.
- Promotion: If you are willing to promote this project, forms of promotion include but are not limited to giving a STAR on GitHub, tweeting, making short videos, writing articles, etc. Based on different promotion channels and effects, you will receive different points rewards. You can use these points to offset the membership fee on the official website or as a discount for commercial version authorization (up to 50% off). There are also other ways to earn points, which are currently under discussion and will be managed and counted by a dedicated business system in the future.
